##A Custom Jekyll Theme For My Babble

This is a basic theme for a Jekyll blog. It creates posts, uses tags, and can display gists.

Right now, I use a few different gems/plugins that Jekyll doesn't normally use/come with (Also use Ruby 1.9.3). They include:

1. rdiscount - _for rendering_ (GEM)
2. activesupport - _for caching_ (GEM)
3. [tag_gen.rb](http://charliepark.org/tags-in-jekyll/)
4. [gist_gen.rb](http://blog.55minutes.com/2012/03/liquid-gist-tag-for-jekyll/#gist-1937862-gist-rb)
5. [youtube.rb](https://gist.github.com/joelverhagen/1805814)
