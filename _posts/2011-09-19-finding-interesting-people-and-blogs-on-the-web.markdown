As we enter the new ear a Web 2.0, social media is blatantly thrown in our face. Why wouldn’t it be? It’s built on Web 2.0. Right? Well yes depending on who you are.

Social media is such a big topic people can get lost relatively easily. There are so many different things to keep track of. Who’s my friend? What information is relevant to me? What am I sharing? The list goes on and on. So I figured I could help out and give a few tips, which helped me, on where to start in the vast world of social media.

  1. **Find a topic you’re interested in.**
The obvious first thing you’ll think of is googling your topic. A lot, and I mean a lot, of information will be at the tips of your fingers when you do this. With the internet being such a big place, you are bound to find people that share the same interests as you. I would recommend industry sites and blogs.
  2. **Find Industry Leaders**
This is the way that I got into social media. Twitter is an invaluable resource in this department. You can follow people that share the same interest as you, and usually they provide good information. For example, I follow Paul Irish and get to look at everything he tweets, which is very interesting to say the least. Facebook would be another good place, but I would recommend Twitter first.
  3. **Ask your friends**
Chances are you’re not alone in the social media world, your friends are out there too. They have probably spent the same amount of time on the web, if not more in my case, and know the ins and outs of everything. A simple, “who/what topics interest you” would probably suffice.
  4. **Follow Friday (taken from Chris Cookley)**
I am new to this and I have been using Twitter for a while now. So follow friday is something on Twitter where people suggest interesting people to follow to all their followers. Wait, that sounds confusing. So lets say I find someone interesting, I would tweet, “@vernacchia, @alex_illium, @whitsmitpurdue #followfriday” or something along those lines. That tells everyone that follows me I find these people interesting enough that I think you would like them as well.

These are the ways that I have found interesting people on the web. While there are more ways to do this, I feel that these work the best. Let me know if there’s anything I didn’t cover that works well for you.
