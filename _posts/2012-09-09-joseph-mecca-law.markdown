I always try to help out my friends in anyway possible. That being said, when they ask me to make a website for them (and boy do a lot of them, I’m sure you other developers can vouch), I charge them a small fraction of what I normally charge others.

One of these projects is [Joseph Mecca Law PC][1], and it is for one of my good friend’s (fraternity brother) dad. When he approached me about it I wasn’t too sure what to expect, but we finally got the ball rolling and it’s starting to look good. Just need a little more content and we will have a functional and information website (which is the main goal).

I can’t wait to get it done and help out my buddy’s dad. If you have ANY SUGGESTIONS that would make it looks cleaner, better, more professional, etc. please drop me a line ([alvernacchia@gmail.com][3]). I don’t spam you, please don’t spam me.

YOU should check it out (not an advertisement I swear) if you are in the NYC/Northern NJ area and need Family Law services.
