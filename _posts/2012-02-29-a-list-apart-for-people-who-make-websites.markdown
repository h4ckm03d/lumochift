I was stumbling around the internet the other day and found an interesting article on [CSS3 vendor prefixes][1]. While this is a great article, and I suggest reading it, this post is about the site I found this particular article on, [A List Apart][2].

They describe themselves as a Magazine that “explores the design, development, and meaning of web content, with a special focus on web standards and best practices.” GREAT!

This blog covers so many topics, and has over 340 posts to date. I would recommend taking a look through their topics, which range from coding to user science. I bet you’d learn at least a little bit.
