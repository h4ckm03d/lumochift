### McAfee Web2.0 Report International Business Adoption 2010

As the web becomes bigger and more people start utilizing Web 2.0, what are big businesses or organizations supposed to do? This article goes in depth about what the advantages, risks, and what can be done to manage those in the business world.

I liked how this article highlighted security issues as one of the reasons that a good portion of businesses don’t use social media. Yes that means at work, they even block it. As I read further, it makes sense. Businesses lost a combined total of over $1.1 billion with Maleware as the leading cause of security issues. I mean if I lost that much you better be sure there was something being limited so it doesn’t happen again.

Even though security is a big issue, businesses still seem to use social media, as it is a huge opportunity for revenue, mainly from marketing. At the end they stated that education is needed. At first I thought that was weird. Who needs education about social media? Oh wait, I am taking a class on it. In this sense education meant educating new users in organizations about the potential threats that are out there while using Web 2.0 (phishing).

I liked this article overall and would suggest it to anyone looking for a good enterprise/big business social media article

### How companies are benefiting from Web 2.0

Unlike the previous paper, this paper is all about the benefits to companies who utilize Web 2.0. It was overall a good article that demonstrated all the good things that can come from utilizing these technologies in the business world.

These researchers surveyed over 1,700 executives from companies across the globe and found 69% of the responding companies have gained measurable benefits from the integration of Web 2.0. That is a huge number and is awesome to see that businesses are doing so well from the integration.

The go onto talk about all the differences that have come from this, increase in productivity, how it has helped internally, externally, and with suppliers, as well as many other things. The point that hopped off the page to me was, “successful adoption requires that the use of these tools be integrated into the flow of users’ work.” Implementation is key. If it’s integrated wrong, or employees/consumers don’t use it correctly then there is potential for trouble.

This actually relates to my thesis topic of social media in higher education. How do you implement it and get it to stick? It’s going to be a tough question to answer, but not impossible.

### Building the Web 2.0 Enterprise

This paper builds off the previously discussed one. It goes more in depth about businesses satisfaction with Web 2.0 and Web Services. I found it interesting that businesses who use Web 2.0 intensely are overall more satisfied with the tools, and they are less likely to stop using them. This makes a lot of sense. From the previous article we found businesses who incorporate Web 2.0 technologies at a higher level make more profit/benefits. If that company is doing a lot better as more tools are implemented, why would they ever stop?

Lots of companies Web 2.0 tools internally. This is where companies seem to be making a lot of changes. They use video conferencing, blogs, RSS, etc. and they all help with the transfer of knowledge. Companies reported collaboration was at an all-time high, and some even went as far to say that products were released ahead of schedule due to this. The organizations where this seems to work are the ones where there are no organizational barriers. Makes sense.

One section I paid the most attention to was, “the tools that count.” It showed that blogs are better than Social Networking Sites (SNS), and that web services reign supreme. I would have definitely thought that SNS would have out ranked blogs, but much to my surprise it didn’t happen. Something I will bring to where ever I end up working in the future.

I could not believe that North America reports the lowest satisfaction with Web 2.0 tools. We created Facebook, MySpace, Twitter, etc. and we don’t like using them. What is going on? Hopefully since 2008 (when this paper was written) something has changed.

### The State of Enterprise 2.0 Adoption Q4 2009

Adoption of Web 2.0 into enterprises (Enterprise 2.0) is a relatively new subject as Web 2.0 is just starting to hit it’s prime. To start, I was very surprised to find 89% of the people surveyed thought Enterprise 2.0 was at the early stages of development in the market maturity life cycle. Facebook started in 2006, Twitter right after, Wikipedia. What are you thinking? I would have to say to all these people, YOU ARE WRONG. If anything we are in the late majority cycle, relative to the whole. Businesses have been trying to use this since it’s existence, yet it’s not adopted yet? I would say it’s not effectively adopted.

This paper discusses the implementation of the technologies. I was surprised to find top-down integration was the lowest percentage. I previously had the notion that all this was implemented by management to make their company better. I was WRONG. Whoops, but it nice to see that the employees have some power in these big organizations and businesses.

The number one business driver behind most buisnesses Enterprise 2.0 initiative was increasing productivity. I thought it was obtaining a substantial return on investment (ROI). When I think about it though, it makes sense as productivity increases revenue. When people are more productive they get more shit done, thus making the company more money.

I was in awe when 82% of the respondents never established an ROI from the implementation of Enterprise 2.0. I was even more surprised when the same percentage ranked themselves very satisfied to somewhat satisfied with their initiative. I am glad that companies are not giving up and realize there is potential.

### Wave 3 - Internal Adoption

Internal adoption of social media is a hard thing to accomplish. Some of the main points of this article include how social media is a global phenomenon in all markets. This means all markets no matter economic, social and cultural development. I feel that this is true in some light. Third world countries will definitely be different. They have limited resources, which disable a lot of people from even accessing the Internet. Other than those countries I would agree with that statement, as the world is starting to rely more heavily on social media.

I was surprised to see that Asian markets are leading in terms of content creation. I can’t be too surprised as one of the previous articles mentioned it as well. I was also surprised to find video clips are growing the fastest. Sharing video clips? With the way smartphones and social networks are going (Facebook with skype, Google hangouts) I can start to see that sharing video will/could be the next big “thing.”

This article mentions how blogs have grown in numbers as well as participation. I remember when no one blogged and Wikipedia was a thing of the past. Surprising that South Korea is the place where the most people read and write blogs. Weird.

I know I may not even need to mention this, but the article made a point to so I will as well. Social media impacts your brand reputation. If you post something on a blog that is potentially harmful to your company, you may see changes in revenue, consumer perspective, as well as many other effects. Be CAREFUL.

### Wave 4 - Power to the People

This paper again highlights that video sharing will be one of the new things, as it has been increasing rapidly.

This quote summarizes a lot of the article and I found it pretty cool:

Social media is a very fast-evolving landscape and one that’s taking an increasingly important role in consumers’ digital lives. Brands that want to engage with consumers in these spaces need to understand how and where and why they are using the many different platforms that enable content creation and sharing.

As I continue reading I find 1 in 13 people are active internet users. Wow. Out of the entire world? That is ridiculous to think about.

Also, social networking sites are growing rapidly. They are the the “new” thing, and consumers actually use the. Facebook with close 1 billion users, I assume people are using them. They go over the rationale of using SNS, and the top one was finding old friends. Over the years I have been using social networking site, I have found a lot of my old friends from high school, middle school, and even some from elementary school.

### Wave 5 - The Socialisation of Brands

As social media has many different forms it is considered a very dynamic environment, meaning apparent danger for those using it, more specifically businesses. This comes into play when you are trying to brand your company. Who is that? What do they do? Are they good at what they do? These are just some of the questions that come to mind when I think of “brands.”

There are obviously bad things that social media can do to brands, but social media is one of those things that can grow your brand rapidly as well. Even though a little under half of the active internet universe joined a brand community, there is still huge demand for a more social and interactive relationships with brands, and I understand why; the benefits. Many companies showed measurable benefits from using social media as discussed when reviewing a previous article. In order to do this, “a deeper understanding of consumer needs and motivations is the key to unlocking a real understanding of social media and its users.”

Brand communities provide huge benefit to the brands involved, driving brand loyalty, endorsement, sales, and much more. “However, understanding the nature of social demand for each consumer, category and market is the key to creating a successful social media experience.”
