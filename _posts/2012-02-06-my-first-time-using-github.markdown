So I finally started to use [Git][1] and [Github][2], and lets just say its been a learning process. I finally figured out how to make repositories and sync them across multiple computers. I forked Twitter’s Bootstrap v2.0 and am starting to work with that.

It’s been a cool process, and I’m happy to start sharing my code for anyone to use. Hopefully it all works out, and I get more experienced with Git and everything.

Check out this [cool tutorial][4] if you need to get started with Git and Github. It really helped me.

[My profile on Github][3] will show you what I’m currently working on.
