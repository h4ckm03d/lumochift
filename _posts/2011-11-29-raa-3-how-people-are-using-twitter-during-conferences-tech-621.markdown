**Purpose**

This study shows evidence on how Twitter can enhance the knowledge of a given group or community by micro-connecting a diverse online audience. So basically, it aims to determine how individuals are using Twitter at conferences and if it is an effective networking tool.

**Methods**

The researchers surveyed 5 different conferences. They received 41 responses. 28 respondents were male and 13 were female. They then analyzed them based on their results, which were a mixture of qualitative and quantitative questions.

**Main Findings**

It was found that 74.1% of conference attendees said they use or had used Twitter at conferences. The reasons for Twitter use include discussing, spreading, and sharing of information.

**Analysis**

This seems to provide no information supporting the fact that Twitter is an effective networking tool. Although, it does present various reasons of why Twitter is used at conferences. This study briefly touches on back-channels, which relates to my research. If I can figure out how back-channels are used at conferences, it will be easier to incorporate them into my research regarding higher education.

Data was collected via a survey, and it was found that 74.1% of conference attendees said they use or had used Twitter at conferences. The reasons for Twitter use include discussing, spreading, and sharing of information. This seems to provide no information in which Twitter is an effective networking tool.
