The past semester, yes I’m still in college, I completed my thesis research for my Master of Science at Purdue University. My research studied the effects of microblogging on communication in the classroom. More specifically, how Twitter affected student’s perception of communication (usually between their professor and them).

I’m not going to get into all the research right now, but in a later blog post I will be explaining my thesis.

Anyway, one of the things I had to measure was an individuals Communication Apprehension Score. This is defined by McCroskey (1977) and is an “individual’s level of fear or anxiety associated with either real or anticipated communication with another person or persons.”

In order to get this score, [students needed to take a test][1], consisting of 24 questions. Since this test was just an HTML page and needed to be printed out in order to complete, I thought it would be cool to make it into a website. Hopefully this would make it easier for students to complete (and it did).

I created the [web application][2] using PHP, XHTML, and CSS3. The source code can also be found on my [Github page][3].

It should be pretty easy to integrate into a website, but if there are any questions (probably won’t be) just post them here and I will get on it.
