As you can probably tell, it’s been a while since I’ve blogged last. Well I’ve been kind of busy lately. I graduated from Purdue in May of this year, receiving my Master of Science in Computer Graphics Technology. If you want to check out my [Thesis][1] (focused on Communication Apprehension in Higher Education while utilizing Twitter) please let me know what you think. I really am always trying to improve any work I do.

And then it was time for the GREATEST adventure of my life…. Europe (with 2 of my best friends). I saved for 2.5 years, working 2-3 jobs at a time, to travel Western Europe for 6 weeks. I had the time of my life, spent way too much money, and experienced so many things that have changed the way I think. If you’re thinking of doing it, I would **HIGHLY** recommend it. It will change you, and you will meet some of the most interesting people in the world (literally). As my friend told me, “Everyone talks about doing it, but you’re actually there experiencing it.” Enough about that, but Barcelona was my favorite destination; Great people, great food, great everything.

Since I got back at the beginning of July, I have been trying to find a full-time job. Unfortunate, but yes, it’s time. Why can’t we be in college forever. I have a couple of prospects as of now, but am holding out for the one I really want. Hopefully I’ll hear back soon.

So since I am basically just biding my time (working at the same place I interned for the past 2.5 years), I figured I would actually do something with my life (update my site [I actually started!!! YES!] and write more blogs). Hopefully in the process I can help you in some way, shape, or form. Feel free to contact me at anytime, I’m here to help. That being said, look forward to some more blog posts soon.

Oh and I will probably put some pictures of some of the places I visited while backpacking Europe.
