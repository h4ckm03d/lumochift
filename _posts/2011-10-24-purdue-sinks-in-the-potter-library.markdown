While being sick the past couple days, and not being able to do a lot, lets just say I have been in the bathroom quite a lot lately. I was at one of my classes, and while I was washing my hands I noticed something that didn’t quite make sense. Isn’t the most common way of tightening and loosening things follow the convention “lefty loosy, righty tighty?”

In this case no, the sinks decided to pull a fast one on me and reverse how I think. In this case I had to turn the knob right to turn on the water and left to turn it off. Does that make sense to anyone? Not me, I am set in my ways of thinking about this at this point in time of my life.

I am trying to relate this back to [Gestalt principles][1] (source does a good job of explaining them, but is missing a few and needs a design overhaul) and [Jakob Nielsen’s usability heuristics][2], but it hard because this doesn’t have to do with the web (mostly counts out Nielsen). I count out Nielsen, but his idea of consistency and standards is what this sink violates. The standard is right to tighten, left to loosen, and this violates it.
