I was recently trying to determine what to do with the rest of my life. Daunting task, I know. I am currently interested in two things, which can cause me to go down two very different life paths; User Experience (UX)/User Interface (UI) and web development (programming, CSS, design, etc.). While I love web development, and have been doing it for quite some time now, I have become very interested in the topic of UX/UI while taking a course during my graduate studies.

I was looking around the web, trying to find sources of knowledge in the UX/UI arena and came across [52 Weeks of UX][1], a great site devoted to entirely to UX. They post at least one new thing new every week, sometimes more, which tend to very useful bits of information.

I have yet to get through week 49 (most current week now), but know I will enjoy my journey through this site.
