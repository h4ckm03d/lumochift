I was looking around the Internet, as usual, and found a site called [Web Designer Wall][1], which aims to provide more information on web design, trends, and it even provides some tutorials. I came to this site for a post on [responsive web design][2], but noticed it had a wealth of information about other things.

I would recommend checking it out more if you are interested in design, UX/UI, and web stuff in general.
