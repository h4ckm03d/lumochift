**Purpose**

This study aims to determine how well Twitter supports user-to-user exchanges, what people are using Twitter for, and what usage or design modifications would make it (more) usable as a tool for collaboration.

**Methods**

Tweets were collected from Twitter.com’s public timeline in four one-hour samples gathered at four-hour intervals, starting at 6 a.m. and ending at 6 p.m. Eastern Standard Time, on January 11, 2008. The were then analyzed by the researcher according to the 5 research questions. Their findings are presented below, which relate to the 5 research questions.

**Main Findings**

  1. Researchers found English is the most common language of Tweets
  2. The “@” sign was primarily used to direct information to a specific persona
  3. Results indicated people tweet most about their own experiences and when “@” is included it focuses more on the addressee
  4. Findings reported that 31.2% of tweets were responded to, which is much higher than previous studies.
  5. The average duration of exchanges to be two exchanges per minute.

**Analysis**

I feel this research was a good addition to the field. I does a good job exploring the @ sign, and how it is used on Twitter. I thought it was interesting how people focus more on personal experiences, but when the @ sign is included they focus more on the addressee. This can help in my research by helping me determine what people use Twitter for, which I can relate to higher education specifically.
