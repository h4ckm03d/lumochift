I’m learning Python! Finally, doing something productive with my life. You know, other than working a part-time job 40 hrs a week, prepping for full-time job interviews, and learning what I need to know about servers to set my own up (more on that in a future post).

Well today is the first day of a online course I signed up for a while ago through a site called [Mechanical MOOC/The Machine][1]. This site is described as, “A massive open online course (MOOC), and an experiment in how to offer these courses.”

I have never taken an online course, not even during the 5 years I was in college, so I am excited to see how this one turns out. The main goal is to learn Python. When I signed up, I was asked if I would prefer to learn alone, or in a group. Just to see if online group learning would work, I signed up for it. I just got added to a mailing list for my group and have met two out of, well I don’t know how many members are in it.

Throughout this process we are using [Codecademy][2], MIT OpenCourseWare, and communities from [OpenStudy][3]. I cannot wait to see where this takes me. I have always wanted to learn Python more in-depth.
