I was roaming around Twitter today, when I came across Dr. V’s tweet ([@mihaela_v][1]) which lead me to [Read Write Web][2], a site dedicated to the web with various other sections relating to other topics. I have only read a few articles, but I plan on visiting this site more and more to see current news about the web. Don’t be fooled by it’s poor design, there are some good articles on this site.
